# AdvisorBot

Advisorbot is a command-line program that helps a cryptocurrency investor analyze data
available on an exchange. The user can enter commands to see a list of available products,
print the minimum or maximum value of a product, print the average value of a product over
a given number of timesteps, predict the next maximum or minimum value of a product, print
the current time, move to the next timestep, or print a list of current orders. The user can
also enter the "help" command to see a list of available commands or get help information
for a specific command. The user can enter the "exit" command to terminate the program
gracefully. Advisorbot provides the user with a convenient way to access and analyze
product data in a command-line interface.
